# moveable-car-charger---GDSC-SC

## Proplem :
One of the problems with electric cars is that the car is charged under very bad conditions, such as running out of charge on travel routes or long and crowded roads.

## Solution of the proplem :
The idea of ​​the project depends on converting solar energy into electricity and then moving it to charge electric cars on the roads.
Solar-powered stations will be provided, and the electrical wires for those stations will be extended over a distance of 10,000 kilometers. At each station five chargers will be available that are wireless connected to the bottom of the cars (and here we will suggest to companies Manufacturing electric cars to changing the location of charging cars to the bottom of the car instead of the side)

## Technologies Used :
##### 1-GoogleStore
##### 2-Flutter Programming Langauge 
##### 3- Google Pay 
##### 4- Google Maps 

The project will be closely linked with Google Store and the App Store, as applications will be available that have been built and programmed using the Flatar programming language. Through these applications, the driver will choose the duration of charging his car with the possibility of paying via Google Pay. Of course, we will link it to Google Map in order to clarify the locations of mobile car charging stations.
